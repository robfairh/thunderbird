# Compute Plane Small Strain

!syntax description /Materials/ComputePlaneSmallStrain

## Description

The material `ComputePlaneSmallStrain` calculates the small incremental
strain for 2D plane strain problems. It can be used for  classical
[thick body plane strain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_stress)
problems, [Weak Plane Stress](/WeakPlaneStress.md) models, or in
[Generalized Plane Strain](tensor_mechanics/generalized_plane_strain.md) simulations.

## Out of Plane Strain

In the classical thick body plane strain problem, the strain
component in the out-of-plane direction (the infinitely thick
direction) is held constant at zero:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:classical_dop_deform_grad}
  \epsilon|^{dop} = 0
\end{equation}
$\epsilon|^{dop}$ is the strain tensor diagonal component for the
direction of the out-of-plane strain.

### Generalized Plane Strain

In the cases of the generalized plane strain and weak plane stress models, the
component of strain and the deformation gradient in the out-of-plane direction
is non-zero. To solve for this out-of-plane strain, we use the out-of-plane
strain variable as the strain tensor component
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:dop_deform_grad}
  \epsilon|^{dop} = \epsilon|^{op}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon|^{dop}$ is the strain tensor diagonal component for
the direction of the out-of-plane strain and $\epsilon|^{op}$ is a
prescribed out-of-plane strain value: this strain value can be
given either as a scalar variable or a nonlinear variable.
The [Generalized Plane Strain](tensor_mechanics/generalized_plane_strain.md)
problems use scalar variables. Multiple scalar variables can be provided such
that one strain calculator is needed for multiple generalized plane strain
models on different subdomains.


## Strain and Deformation Gradient Formulation

The definition of a small total linearized strain is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:def_small_total_strain}
  \epsilon_{ij} = \frac{1}{2} \left( u_{i,j} + u_{j,i}  \right)
\end{equation}
The values of each of the strain tensor components depends on the direction
selected by the user as the out-of-plane direction.

#### $Z$-Direction of Out-of-Plane Strain (Default)

The default out-of-plane direction is along the $z$-axis. For this direction
the strain tensor, [eqn:def_small_total_strain], is given as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:strain_tensor}
  \boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \begin{bmatrix}
                u_{x,x} & \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{x,y} + u_{y,x} \right) & 0 \\
                \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{x,y} + u_{y,x} \right) & u_{y,y} & 0 \\
                0 & 0 & \epsilon|^{dop}
              \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon|^{dop}$ is defined in [eqn:dop_deform_grad].
As in the classical presentation of the strain tensor in plane
strain problems, the components of the strain tensor associated
with the $z$-direction are zero; these zero components indicate no
coupling between the in-plane and the out-of-plane strains.

#### $X$-Direction of Out-of-Plane Strain

If the user selects the out-of-plane direction as along the
$x$-direction, the strain tensor from [eqn:def_small_total_strain]
is given as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:deform_grads_xdirs}
  \boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \begin{bmatrix}
                \epsilon|^{dop} & 0 & 0 \\
                0 & u_{y,y} & \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{y,z} + u_{z,y} \right) \\
                0 & \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{y,z} + u_{z,y} \right) & u_{z,z}
              \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
so that the off-diagonal components of the strain tensor associated
with the $x$-direction are zeros.

#### $Y$-Direction of Out-of-Plane Strain

If the user selects the out-of-plane direction as along the
$y$-direction, the strain tensor from [eqn:def_small_total_strain]
is given as
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:deform_grads_ydirs}
  \boldsymbol{\epsilon} = \begin{bmatrix}
                u_{x,x} & 0 & \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{x,z} + u_{z,x} \right) \\
                0 & \epsilon|^{dop} & 0 \\
                \frac{1}{2} \left(u_{x,z} + u_{z,x} \right) & 0 & u_{z,z}
              \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
so that the off-diagonal components of the strain tensor associated
with the $y$-direction are zeros.

### Volumetric Locking Correction for Strain Tensor

If selected by the user, the strain tensor is conditioned with
a $\bar{B}$ formulation to mitigate volumetric locking of the elements.
The volumetric locking correction is applied to the total strain
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:vlc_strain}
  \boldsymbol{\epsilon}|_{vlc} = \boldsymbol{\epsilon} + \frac{\left( \boldsymbol{\epsilon}_V - tr(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}) \right)}{3} \cdot \boldsymbol{I}
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\epsilon}_V$ is the volumetric strain and $\boldsymbol{I}$
is the Rank-2 identity tensor. For more details about the theory
behind [eqn:vlc_strain] see the
[Volumetric Locking Correction](/tensor_mechanics/VolumetricLocking.md)
documentation.

### Generalized Plane Strain

As an example, the use of this plane strain class with the
[Generalized Plane Strain](tensor_mechanics/generalized_plane_strain.md)
simulations uses the scalar out-of-plane strains. The tensor mechanics
[MasterAction](/Modules/TensorMechanics/Master/index.md) is used to create the
`ComputePlaneSmallStrain` class with the `planar_formulation = GENERALIZED_PLANE_STRAIN`
and `strain = SMALL` settings.

Note that the argument for the `scalar_out_of_plane_strain` parameter is the
name of the scalar strain variable

### $Y$-Direction of Out-of-Plane Strain

This plane strain class is used to model plane strain with an out-of-plane strain
in directions other than in the $z$-direction. As an example, the tensor mechanics
[MasterAction](/Modules/TensorMechanics/Master/index.md) can be used to create
the `ComputePlaneFiniteStrain` class for a $y$-direction out-of-plane strain with
the `planar_formulation = PLANE_STRAIN` and the `out_of_plane_direction = y`
settings.
