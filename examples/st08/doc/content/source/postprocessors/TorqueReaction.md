# Torque Reaction

!syntax description /Postprocessors/TorqueReaction

## Description

The postprocessor `TorqueReaction` calculates the applied torque from the reaction forces, coupled as
AuxVariables, about a user specified axis of rotation.

TorqueReaction takes a scalar approach to calculating the sum of the acting torques by projecting
both the reaction force vector and the position vector (the coordinates of the node upon which the
force is applied) onto the axis of rotation and applying the Pythagorean theorem, as in a statics
course.  This scalar approach allows the postprocessor to accept any axis of rotation direction.

The torque from the reaction forces is calculated, as shown in [eq:calculate_torque_vector]
relative to the user specified axis of rotation origin and direction.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:calculate_torque_vector}
  \begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{\tau} & = \hat{P}_n \times \mathcal{f} \\
    \hat{P}_n & = \left( P_c - P_o \right) - \frac{\left( P_c - P_o \right) \ cdot d}{|d|^2} \cdot d
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{f}$ is the applied reaction force vector, $P_c$ is the current node position, $P_o$
is the origin of the axis of rotation, and $d$ is the direction vector of the axis of rotation.  The
component of the torque acting along the user specified axis of rotation vector, $\tau_c$ is
calcuated as [eq:calculate_torque_component]:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:calculate_torque_component}
  \tau_c = \frac{\boldsymbol{\tau} \cdot d}{|d|^2} \ cdot d
\end{equation}
where $\boldsymbol{\tau}$ is the torque vector calculated in [eq:calculate_torque_vector] and
$d$ is the axis of rotation direction vector.
